\usage{
simpleMap(
  coordinates,
  color,
  strings,
  regions = 0,
  plot,
  ratio_string,
  fq,
  lons,
  lats
)
}
\arguments{
\item{coordinates}{coordinates with country codes and matched strings filtered by \code{getCoordinates()}}

\item{color}{character string. indicating, which color is assigned to each country code in order.}

\item{strings}{character string. In form of regular expression that filter the data frames. The first string is shown on the plot.}

\item{regions}{numeric. Specify the level of regional borders. By default \code{0} displaying only country borders.}

\item{plot}{logical. If \code{FALSE} then the plot will not be printed but saved as .png in the current working directory.}

\item{ratio_string}{character string. Ratio of occurrences in the polygon from \code{topComp()}.}

\item{fq}{character string. Number of occurrences in the designated polygon and in total.}

\item{lons}{numeric. Vector of longitudinal coordinates defining the polygon.}

\item{lats}{numeric. Vector of latitudinal coordinates defining the polygon.}
}
\value{
A plot in the current R session or as .png in the working directory. If directly generated by \code{top()}, it displays the first string and the total occurrences. If generated by \code{topCompOut()}, it displays the string, the ratio as a percentage and the number of occurrences in the designated polygon and in total.
}
\description{
The function generates a map plotting all locations, filtered by \code{getCoordinates()}. The plot also displays additional information if used by \code{topCompOut()}
