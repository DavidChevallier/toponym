\description{
This function returns country and region designations used by the \code{toponym} package.
}
\details{
If you enter an individual country designation, you receive the three different designations (IS02, ISO3, name).

If you enter "ISO2" or "ISO3", you receive a vector of all ISO-codes of the respective length.

If you enter "names", you receive a vector of all country names.

If you enter "country table", you receive a data frame with all three designations for every country.

Region designations are retrieved from the \code{geodata} package map data. The list of region designations may be incomplete. For mapping purposes, \code{geodata} is used throughout this package.
