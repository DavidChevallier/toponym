\arguments{
\item{countries}{Character string with country code abbreviations (check \url{https://www.geonames.org/countries/} for a list of available countries) specifying, the toponyms of which countries are checked.}

\item{count}{numeric. The number of the most frequent endings which will be tested, e.g. by default the top ten most frequent endings in Germany.}

\item{len}{numeric. The character length of the endings, e.g. by default three-character-long endings.}

\item{rat}{numeric. The ratio (a number between 0.0 and 1) of how many occurrences of one ending need to be in the polygon.}

\item{lons}{numeric. Vector of longitudinal coordinates defining the polygon.}

\item{lats}{numeric. Vector of latitudinal coordinates defining the polygon.}
}
\value{
A data frame printed out and saved in the global environment. It shows the ending surpassing the ratio, at what percentage and the frequency.
}
\description{
The function sorts the toponyms in the given countries by frequency. It then tests which lie in the given polygon, printing out a data frame with those endings which match the ratio criteria and are potential candidates for further examination. The coordinates form the polygon, which roughly resembles the Slavic settlement zone in Germany. It is generated with \href{https://www.google.com/maps/about/mymaps/}{Google My Maps}.
