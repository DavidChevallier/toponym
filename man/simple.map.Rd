\title{Plots locations on a map}
\usage{
simple.map(x, y, cc, color, strings, plot, ratio_string, fq)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{numeric. Latitude of locations filtered by \code{get.coordinates()}}

\item{y}{numeric. Longitude of locations filtered by \code{get.coordinates()}}

\item{cc}{character string. Country code of locations filtered by \code{get.coordinates()}}

\item{color}{character string indicating, which color is assigned to each country code in order.}

\item{strings}{Character strings in form of regular expression that filter the data frames. The first string is shown on the plot.}

\item{plot}{logical. If \code{FALSE} then the plot will not be printed but saved as .png in the current working directory.}

\item{ratio_string}{character string. Ratio of occurrences in the polygon from \code{top.candidates()}.}

\item{fq}{character string. Number of occurrences in the designated polygon and in total.}
}
\value{
A plot in the current R session or as .png in the working directory. If directly generated by \code{top()}, it displays the first string and the total occurrences. If generated by \code{candidates.maps()}, it displays the string, the ratio as a percentage and the number of occurrences in the designated polygon and in total.
}
\description{
The function generates a map plotting all locations, filtered by \code{get.coordinates()}. The plot also displays additional information if used by \code{candidates.maps()}
