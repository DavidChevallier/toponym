\title{Retrieves the most frequent toponyms in a given polygon relative to the countries}
\usage{
topComp(
  countries,
  count = 0,
  len,
  rat,
  type = "$",
  lons,
  lats,
  feat.class = "P",
  freq.type = "abs"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{countries}{character string. Country code abbreviations or names (use \code{country()} for a list of available countries) specifying the countries of which toponyms are checked.}

\item{count}{numeric. The number of the most frequent toponyms which are included. If unspecified all toponyms satisfying the search criteria are included.}

\item{len}{numeric. The character length of the toponyms}

\item{rat}{numeric. The ratio of how many occurrences of one toponym need to be in the polygon. If freq.type is "abs" the ratio is between 0 and 1, if freq.type is "rel" it is between 0 and indefinite.}

\item{type}{character string. Either "$" (suffixes) or "^" (prefixes)}

\item{lons}{numeric. Vector of longitudinal coordinates defining the polygon.}

\item{lats}{numeric. Vector of latitudinal coordinates defining the polygon.}

\item{feat.class}{character string with feature classes (check \url{http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/readme.txt} for the list and names of all feature classes in the data). By default, it is \code{P}.}

\item{freq.type}{character string. If set to "abs" (the default), ratios of absolute frequencies inside the area and in the countries as a whole are computed. If set to "rel", ratios of relative frequencies inside the area and outside the area will be computed.}
}
\value{
A data frame printed out and saved in the global environment. It shows the toponyms surpassing the ratio, the ratio (expressed as percentage if freq.type is "abs") and the frequency.
}
\description{
The function sorts the toponyms in the given countries by frequency. It then tests which  ones lie in the given polygon, printing out a data frame with those toponyms that match the ratio criteria and are, thus, potential candidates for further examination. The coordinates can be defined using createPolygon().
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
topComp("GB", count = 100, len = 4, rat = .9,
 lons = toponym::danelaw_polygon$lons,
 lats = toponym::danelaw_polygon$lats)
## prints and saves a data frame of the top 100 four-character-long endings in Great Britain
## if more than 90\% of the places lie in the newly defined polygon
## which frames the Danelaw


topComp("GB", len = 3, rat = 1,
 lons = toponym::danelaw_polygon$lons,
 lats = toponym::danelaw_polygon$lats,
 freq.type="rel")
## prints and saves a data frame of all three-character-long endings in Great Britain
## if they have greater relative frequencies within Danelaw than outside of Danelaw


topComp(c("BE", "NL"), rat = .8,
 lons = toponym::flanders_polygon$lons,
 lats = toponym::flanders_polygon$lats)

## prints and saves a data frame of the top 10 three-character-long endings in Belgium
## and Netherlands viewed as a unit if more than 80\% of the places lie
## in the newly defined polygon which frames Flanders.
