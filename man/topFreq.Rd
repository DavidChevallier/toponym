\title{Retrieves the most frequent toponyms}
\usage{
topFreq(countries, len, limit, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{countries}{character string with country reference (name or iso-code)}

\item{len}{numeric. The character length of the toponyms.}

\item{limit}{numeric. The number of the most frequent toponyms.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters:
\itemize{
\item\code{type} character string. Either by default "$" (ending) or "^" (beginning)
\item\code{feat.class} character string with feature classes (check \url{http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/readme.txt} for the list and names of all feature classes in the data). By default, it is \code{P}.
\item\code{freq.type} character string. If "abs" (the default), ratios of absolute frequencies inside the area and in the countries as a whole are computed. If "rel", ratios of relative frequencies inside the area and outside the area will be computed.
\item\code{polygon} data frame. selects toponyms only inside the polygon
}}
}
\value{
A table with toponym names and their frequency.
}
\description{
This function returns which toponyms are most frequent in countries or a polygon.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
topFreq(countries = "Namibia", len = 3, limit = 10)
## returns the top ten most frequent toponym endings
## of three-character length in Namibia

topFreq(
  countries = "GB", len = 3, limit = 10,
  polygon = toponym::danelaw_polygon
)
## returns the top ten most frequent toponym endings
## in the polygon which is inside the United Kingdom.
