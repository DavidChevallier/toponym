\title{Saves multiple maps and toponym data}
\usage{
topCompOut(countries, len, rat, polygon, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{countries}{character string with country reference (name or iso-code)}

\item{len}{numeric. The character length of the toponyms.}

\item{rat}{numeric. The ratio (a number between 0.0 and 1) of how many occurrences of one toponym need to be in the polygon.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters:
\itemize{
\item\code{df} logical. If \code{TRUE} then the filtered data frames will be saved in the global environment.
\item\code{csv} logical. If \code{TRUE} then the filtered data frames will be saved as .csv in the current working directory.
\item\code{type} character string. Either by default "$" (ending) or "^" (beginning)
\item\code{feat.class} character string with feature classes (check \url{http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/readme.txt} for the list and names of all feature classes in the data). By default, it is \code{P}.
\item\code{freq.type} character string. If "abs" (the default), ratios of absolute frequencies inside the area and in the countries as a whole are computed. If "rel", ratios of relative frequencies inside the area and outside the area will be computed.
\item\code{polygon} data frame. Polygon for comparison with the country.
}}

\item{count}{numeric. The number of the most frequent toponyms which will be tested.}
}
\value{
A number of data frames and plots saved in a sub folder (called "data frames" and "plots") in the working directory. If wanted, it stores the ratio surpassing toponyms in a data frame in the package environment.
}
\description{
The function applies the list of toponyms returned by \code{topComp()} to \code{top()}.
}
\details{
A series of maps showing the toponym, ratio in percentage and numbers will be generated and locally saved.

A general and meaningful ratio is not determinable if we take the different areas (i.e. the possible polygons to be compared) and varying frequencies of specific toponyms into account.
For example, an ending may only occur five times in total, thus the distribution on a percentage basis is a less conclusive indicator for potential candidates.

\dontrun{
topCompOut(
  countries = "BE", count = 100, len = 3, rat = .5,
  lons = toponym::flanders_polygon$lons, lats = toponym::flanders_polygon$lats
)

## generates and saves the data frames & maps of the top hundred three-character-long endings
## in Belgium if more than 50\% of the places lie in the polygon for Flanders.
