\description{
This function plots a user-specific data frame onto a map.
}
\details{
This function's purpose is to allow users to provide own data frames or curated ones exported by this package.

The data frame must have at least two columns called \code{latitude} & \code{longtitude}.

If the data frame has a column \code{color}, the function will assign every value in that column to the respective coordinates and ignore the additional parameter \code{color}.

If the data frame has a column \code{group}, the function will group data and display a legend.

If the data frame has a \code{color} and a \code{group} column, the assignment must match each other. Every \code{group} must be assigned a unique color throughout the data frame.

If \code{regions}  is set to a value higher than 0, the data frame must have a column \verb{country codes}.
