\title{Saves all maps and data frames based on the output of \code{top.candidates()}}
\usage{
candidates.maps(
  countries,
  count,
  len,
  df = FALSE,
  csv = TRUE,
  rat,
  type = "$",
  lons,
  lats,
  feat.class = "P"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{countries}{character string with country code abbreviations (check \url{https://www.geonames.org/countries/} for a list of available countries) specifying, the toponyms of which countries are checked.}

\item{count}{numeric. The number of the most frequent endings which will be tested.}

\item{len}{numeric. The character length of the endings.}

\item{df}{logical. If \code{TRUE} then the filtered data frames will be saved in the global environment.}

\item{csv}{logical. If \code{TRUE} then the filtered data frames will be saved as .csv in the current working directory.}

\item{rat}{numeric. The ratio (a number between 0.0 and 1) of how many occurrences of one ending need to be in the polygon}

\item{type}{character string. Either by default "$" (ending) or "^" (beginning)}

\item{lons}{numeric. Vector of longitudinal coordinates defining the polygon.}

\item{lats}{numeric. Vector of latitudinal coordinates defining the polygon.}

\item{feat.class}{character string with feature classes (check \url{http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/readme.txt} for the list and names of all feature classes in the data). By default, it is \code{p}.}
}
\value{
A number of data frames and plots saved in a sub folder (called "data frames" and "plots") in the working directory. If wanted, it stores the ratio surpassing toponyms in a data frame in the global environment.
}
\description{
The function applies the list of toponyms returned by \code{top.candidates()} to \code{top()}. A series of maps showing the toponym, ratio in percentage and numbers will be generated and locally saved.
}
\details{
The goal is to find and generate maps of toponyms which are potentially worthwhile to be further examined by hand or other means.
A general and meaningful ratio is not determinable if we take the different areas (i.e. the possible polygons to be compared) and varying frequencies of specific toponyms into account.
For example, an ending may only occur five times in total, thus the distribution on a percentage basis is a less conclusive indicator for potential candidates.

\examples{
\dontrun{
candidates.maps(countries = "BE", count = 100, len = 3, rat = .5,
lons = toponym::flanders_polygon$lons, lats = toponym::flanders_polygon$lats)

## generates and saves the data frames & maps of the top hundred three-character-long endings
## in Belgium if more than 50\% of the places lie in the polygon for Flanders.
